# Layoffs Data Cleaning

This project includes a SQL script to clean and preprocess the Layoffs dataset. It focuses on improving data quality for further analysis and visualization.

---

## File Included

- `layoffs_data_cleaning.sql`: SQL script to clean the dataset

---

## What the Script Does

The script performs the following cleaning steps:

- Removes rows with `NULL` values in critical columns  
- Standardizes column names to ensure consistency  
- Corrects incorrect or inconsistent date formats  
- Trims unwanted white spaces from string fields  
- Fixes inconsistent entries (e.g., company names, categories)  
- Removes duplicate records  

---

## Use Case

This script is useful as a **preprocessing step** before:

- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Creating dashboards using Power BI, Tableau, etc.
- Feeding cleaned data into machine learning pipelines

---

##  How to Use

1. Open your SQL environment (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
2. Import the Layoffs dataset into your database
3. Run the `layoffs_data_cleaning.sql` script
4. The cleaned dataset will be ready for further analysis
